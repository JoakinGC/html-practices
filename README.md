# HTML Practices (2020)

This repository contains the HTML exercises and practice files I created back in 2020 when I first started learning web development. At the time, I had no idea how to use Git or GitHub, so I wasn’t able to publish them—until now. The entire repository is in Spanish.

## 📝 About the Content

- This course covers the basics of **HTML5** and its new features.
- It includes practical exercises focused on:
  - Semantic structure using modern tags
  - Accessible forms
  - Multimedia elements (`<video>`, `<audio>`)
  - Tables, lists, and links
  - Layout best practices

Each file includes examples and exercises that go along with the lessons from the course.

##  Background

This project represents my very first steps in web development. While the code may not be perfect or follow today’s best practices, I’m sharing it as part of my learning journey and growth as a developer.

##  Next Steps

In the future, I plan to:
- Review and improve the exercises using modern best practices.
- Compare the 2020 code with updated versions that include CSS and JavaScript.
- Add comments and documentation to explain each example more clearly.
